    Analyze the following proposal:
    EB Airlines

"Engine Burning Airlines" has commissioned us to develop an application to manage their reservation system and they ask us for a web application that can be executed on mobile devices.
  
Passengers must log in the website to be able to do anything. Otherwise, they can only see the front page where offers and general information appears.
Once logged in, passengers can check for availability, book tickets, etc. in which case they can choose a seat.
  
The administrator can cancel tickets, check flights status and updates flight schedules.
  
The bank sees the payments that have been done by the passengers and validate the card details. 
  
In order to avoid losing clients, the process to book a flight must be easy to understand and easy to use. We need our clients to be comfortable with the design of the web page. Could be interesting to develop an adaptive design depending on the screen resolution of the device where it runs.
  
This company offered a great number of flights (identified by a code) every day so we will need to store a great amount of information and we will need to make a backup process every day.
For each flight we know its code, the city of origin and the destination. We also need to know how many seats are available in it.
  
The actors are passengers, adminstrators and the banks, that are the organizations. Passengers and administrators are a subtype of User. Both of them have an email, password, name and a telephone number. But only the passengers have a nationality.
